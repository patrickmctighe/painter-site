      "As a landlord, I've hired a number of painters through the years, but i have to say that using Patrick was the best experience I've ever had, he is not only great at painting,but he is incredibly neat and tidy. Not a spec left anywhere. He brought our project in on time and did a excelent job. I highly recommend him."</p>
